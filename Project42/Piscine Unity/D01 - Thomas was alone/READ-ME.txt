This project is part of a series of the Unity "Piscine" projects at School 42.

This one is day 01,
The objective of this day is to learn how 2D physics, tags, layers and scenes work.

Update for my book because elements were not in the original version:
- UI controls.
- The levels of the doors and turrets.
- The teleporter that is fixed.
- R for restart works differently.

On this day I was rated 70/100.
