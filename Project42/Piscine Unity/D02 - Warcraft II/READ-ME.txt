This project is part of a series of the Unity "Piscine" projects at School 42.

This one is day 02,
The objective of this day is to learn how 2D physics, tags, layers and scenes work.

Update for my book because elements were not in the original version:
- The possibility of attack building and orcs.
- animation attack and death orc, and dead building.
- animation when buildings are damaged.
- sound when a team attack a player, sound when he destroy a building, sound when a unit is attacked.
- when a unit attack a unit, he chases him.
- IA attack a command post or others building and humans if they are nearest.
- IA defend their command post when he is attacked.
- if a building is destroyed then the spawning troops is increased.
- the game can be finished.
- R for restart.

On this day I was rated 50/100.
