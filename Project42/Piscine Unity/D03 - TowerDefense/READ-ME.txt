The objective of this day is to learn the advanced inputs and 2D GUI.

Update for my book because elements were not in the original version:
- system of speed pause,x1,x2,x4 works better.
- the score in the end of the level works better.
- when we start the game we can click on Play to begin.
- fixed : we can pay for a tower with its cost of energy equal to the cost we have left.
- Upgrades with his UI with right click on a tower.
- Shortcut 1,2,3 and left click to put a tower.
- Fireball to destroy everything on the map with a time to reload.
