This project is part of a series of the Unity "Piscine" projects at School 42.

This one is day 00,
The goal of this day is to learn how Assets, GameObject, Behavior, Inputs, and Transform work.
Update for my book because elements were not in the original version:
- UI controls.
- UI Score.
- Escape to leave.
- FlappyBird background has been resized.

On this day I was rated 100/100.
